Consists of a set of scripts/notebooks contributing to PPI contextualizing using published single-cell datasets (scRNA-seq+snRNAseq) from Chan Zuckerberg's Cell*Gene databases. 

We leveraged this high-dimensional dataset having ~108M single cell data encompassing 1766 datasets & 986 cell types/states. 

Broad steps:
1). Mapping Gene: Interactors & creating gene-associated PPI file. 
2). Retrieving gene expression data across tissues * cell types/states 
3). QC & basic filtering (performed per gene associated PPI file) 
4) Downstream analysis (include H1+H2 testing followed by PPI prioritization) 

Detailed steps are explained in individual notebooks.
